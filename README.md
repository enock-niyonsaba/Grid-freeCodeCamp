Project Structure
CSS Styles

The CSS structure is designed for optimal readability and responsive adaptability. Key styles include:

*,
::before,
::after {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
body {
  font-family: 'Baskervville', serif;
  color: linen;
  background-color: rgb(20, 30, 40);
}

    Font Selection: Uses 'Baskervville' for body text and 'Raleway' for headings.
    Grid Layout: The main content is displayed using grid-template-columns, with responsive adjustments for smaller screens.

HTML Structure

The HTML follows a semantic structure with section and article tags, providing a clear division of content. Each section is structured to be easy to navigate and styled as follows:

<main>
  <section class="heading">
    <header class="hero">
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png" alt="hero image" class="hero-img" />
      <h1 class="hero-title">OUR NEW CURRICULUM</h1>
      <p class="hero-subtitle">Project-based learning approach</p>
    </header>
    <div class="author">
      <p>By freeCodeCamp</p>
    </div>
  </section>
</main>

Usage Instructions
